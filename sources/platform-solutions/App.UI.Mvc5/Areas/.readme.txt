This application use areas to isolate code for each of the main top menu and user sections.

Each area consists of a landing controller, that will direct the request to the area primary controller and also determine the area base route to avoid conflicts and route resolution problems.

Area controllers should inherit from the specific '__AreaBaseController' which then inherits from '__BaseController'
