# About
This is a MVC5 starter kit application with all the initial (and boring) boilerplate already implemented. Some of the main features are:

- Bootstrap 4 based layout.
- Realtime ready with SignalR.
- Asp.Net Identity with role permissions.
- Dependency injection with SimpleInjector.
- Out of the box mailing system with support for native SMTP and MailGun Api.
- Out of the box dynamic image thumb generation with ImageResizer and Cloudinary.
- Globalization ready and by-user language, region and timezone definition.
- Error logging with Serilog.

And more to come...
